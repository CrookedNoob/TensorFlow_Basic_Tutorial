# Simple Linear Regression with TensorFlow

### Simple Linear Regression<br/>
It is a mathematical equation(generally of a straight line: **y**= *m* **x** + *c*, where **y** is *ordinate/vertical axis*, **x** is the *horizontal axis* and **m** is the *slope* and **c** is the *intercept*)<br/><br/>
In the case of Machine Learning the obove equation is represented as:<br/>
###### **y** *= w* **X** *+ b*<br/>
where **Y** is the value we want to *predict*, **X** is the *independent variable/predictor* and **w** is the *weight* and **b** is the *bias*<br/>
